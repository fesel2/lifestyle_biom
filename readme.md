# Unraveling the effects of smoking on human gut microbiome and associated immune system interactions

## Abstract
Dysbiosis, or the alteration of microbiome composition, is frequently linked to various diseases. However, recent research highlights that lifestyle factors, such as smoking, also significantly impact the
microbiome. Smoking, in particular, affects the entire body and plays a crucial role in cardiovascular
diseases and cancer.  
In this study, data from the Human Functional Project was utilized to assess microbiome changes associated with smoking. Additionally, a random forest model was employed to predict smoking habits based
on microbiome data. Although the modelâ€™s performance was suboptimal and the differences between
smokers and non-smokers were subtle, the findings were consistent with previous research.
Furthermore, microbiome data was integrated with metabolic and immune data to explore the potential effects of altered microbiomes on the immune system. Three biological modules associated with
smoking were identified, encompassing features across multiple omics. These findings illustrate the
connection between smoking-related differentially abundant species, cholesterol levels, and various cytokines.  
This study serves as a preliminary effort to develop reliable models for predicting smoking status and
to identify key interactions between the gut microbiome and the immune system. Further it provides
evidence of the association of Cholesterol with Smoking and the gut microbiome.

## Remarks
This project was part of my masters degree. I did it during an ERASMUS+ program in Lisbon april-july 2024. Additionally to the actual research project a review was written to summarize the current state of research regarding this topic with the title: 'The human gut in smoking research - Current findings and potential for future research'. Both works are avaiable here as pdf for download.
